9,275,openended4,"One hot summer day, one of the people I met was named John. John is an elderly retiree who lives in an old-fashioned apartment with no air conditioning. One day, the temperature suddenly soared to 40 degrees Celsius, and the air was filled with heat. John got into trouble with heatstroke because he didn't take measures to prevent it in time. When I visited John that afternoon, I found him lying on the sofa, his forehead covered with sweat, his face pale, and his breath short. He told me he felt dizzy, nauseous and weak, and even had some confused thoughts. I knew right away that he might have had heat stroke. I quickly helped him find some cold water, let him slowly drink, and use a wet towel to cool his forehead. Meanwhile, I called the emergency services and asked for medical help. With the help of paramedics, John was taken to hospital for treatment",1,156,61.17,51.52,19.9,20.23,15.6,19.23,87.18,67.95,49.36,14.1,12.18,4.49,0,0,7.05,0,1.92,13.46,5.77,2.56,11.54,5.77,3.85,5.13,1.28,17.31,5.77,5.13,2.56,1.92,0,0.64,7.69,0.64,7.05,3.21,1.28,0,1.28,0,0.64,0,6.41,3.21,3.21,1.28,0,1.28,0,0,0,0,13.46,5.13,1.92,0,0,0,1.92,8.33,0,0,0,7.05,0,0,0,0,2.56,0,1.28,1.28,0,0,7.05,2.56,0.64,0,0,0,0,0.64,0,0.64,0,1.92,0,0.64,0,0,1.28,0,5.77,11.54,0,0.64,4.49,0.64,0,5.13,7.05,10.9,1.28,0.64,0,0,0,0,0,15.38,5.77,8.33,0,0,0.64,0.64,0
