By planting more trees, we can provide habitat for wildlife, help maintain the ecological balance and protect biodiversity. Trees absorb a lot of heat as they grow, helping to lower temperatures and mitigate the urban heat island effect. They also provide shade and fan effect during hot summer months, alleviating the need for air conditioning. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the air through photosynthesis and release oxygen.
