Low-income people may not be able to afford quality housing, and they may live near sources of pollution, such as industrial areas, high traffic areas, or older buildings. This makes them more vulnerable to the direct effects of pollutants. Children have weaker physical development and immune systems that are more sensitive to pollutants. If they live in a heavily polluted community, they may be more susceptible to the effects of air pollution, leading to respiratory problems, allergies and other health issues. Older people may have weaker physical functions and they may have chronic diseases or health problems that make them more vulnerable to the effects of air pollution. In addition, older people often need to spend more time at home, and their health risks may be higher if their homes are exposed to air pollution. In addition, vulnerable groups may face other challenges in dealing with the effects of air pollution, such as lack of adequate healthcare, education and information. This can make it more difficult for them to take proper precautions or seek treatment.","Yes","Residential areas","Participate in and support local environmental policies and initiatives, such as promoting renewable energy, reducing industrial emissions and improving the efficiency of waste disposal, participate in environmental protection activities in the community, such as afforestation, garbage removal, minimizing the use of personal vehicles and choosing to walk, cycle or use public transport.","Text Messages; Social Media; Newsletter from the city/county to your email; neighborhood associations","Connect with local working group to be the messenger to deliver this information to your neighborhood","0ca902a7f50b0dc5","Active",177,"shanwotsonvsvsvsvs@gmail.com",NA,"No","Urban Triage",NA,"No",NA,1994,"$150,000 to $174,999","Bachelor’s degree","Resident; Worker",177,"shanwotsonvsvsvsvs@gmail.com","Urban Triage","6223 Lakeview Boulevard, Middleton, Wisconsin, 53562","No","White","1994","$150,000 to $174,999","Bachelor’s degree","43.0951457713315",-89.4865099415115,"81","6223 Lakeview Boulevard, Middleton, Wisconsin, 53562, , , ","Match","Exact","6223 LAKEVIEW BLVD, MIDDLETON, WI, 53562","49466579","L","55","025","011101","3005","53562","Not Hispanic","$150,000 to $199,999","Bachelors Degree or Higher","55025011101","550250111013005"
