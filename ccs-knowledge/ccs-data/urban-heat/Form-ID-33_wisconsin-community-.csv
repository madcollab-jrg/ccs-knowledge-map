I immediately realized that she might be in danger of heat stroke, so I walked over to her and asked if she needed help. She insisted she was fine, just a little hot. However, her tone was vague and her actions became erratic. I immediately realized that this was an emergency, so I decided to take action right away. I helped her get out of the sun-soaked garden and into the shade. I offered her a glass of cold water and patted her cheek gently to help keep her awake. I called the emergency services immediately and told them about our situation. They sent an ambulance immediately. While waiting for rescuers, I continued to give her fluids and dabbed her forehead and neck with a damp towel to help lower her body temperature.

At first the weather was cool, however, as we continued up the hill the sun became hotter and hotter, and the air felt hot and humid. Although we try to stay hydrated, we soon start to feel tired and low on energy due to the strenuous exercise and heat. I began to feel dizzy and have a headache, and gradually became weak. I realized it could be a sign of heat stroke. I told my friends, and they started noticing abnormalities in their bodies, too. We found a shady place to rest and kept exercise to a minimum. I felt worse and worse, I had a bad headache, and I even had symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Friends are experiencing similar symptoms. In an emergency, we immediately sought help and called the emergency number. Rescue workers arrived at the scene and provided us with first aid. They moved us to a shady spot and provided us with cooling towels and enough water to keep us hydrated. After a period of rest and medical care, our symptoms gradually eased. Rescuers advised us to regain our strength slowly and avoid exposure to the heat.

The most obvious way that people are impacted is through displacement. When the city becomes too hot to live in, people move out of the city and into other areas, leaving their homes behind. This is especially true in cities that have been built up over time and don't offer much in terms of green spaces or places to cool down.

Another way that people are affected is through their access to air conditioning. In some areas, there is no air conditioning at all—and if there is, it's not affordable for everyone who needs it. Others may not have access to electricity at all. This means that they're stuck without any way to cool down when temperatures rise too high.","used public transportation, biking or walking instead of driving a car.; switched to renewable energy sources (e.g. solar panels or wind power) for my home.; installed energy-efficient lighting or appliances in my home or weatherized my home; installed green infrastructure like a rain garden or rain barrel at my home or neighborhood",Local government can help mitigate urban heat in my community by encouraging the use of green roofs and other sustainable practices.,"Local news outlets (TV, radio, newspapers); Social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook)",Yes,"In the face of climate change, it's important for local governments to take steps to reduce urban heat.
