Choose loose, breathable clothing and avoid dark, tightly sealed clothing. The breathable material helps sweat evaporate, taking away body heat and leaving you feeling cooler. Use umbrellas, hats, sunglasses, etc. to shield yourself from direct sunlight and reduce your exposure to the sun. When outdoors, try to find shade, such as under a tree or in the shade of a building. Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun. Hot weather can easily lead to dehydration, so pay attention to adding enough water.

Due to heat absorption and release from buildings and roads, temperatures in cities tend to be several degrees higher than in suburban or rural areas. This means that in the summer, we may face longer periods of hot weather with higher temperatures. This poses discomfort and health risks for those who do not have air conditioning or live in older buildings. Second, urban heat affects our air quality. The combination of hot weather and pollutants in cities can lead to higher concentrations of pollutants in the air, such as ozone and particulate matter. This can cause or worsen health problems for people with respiratory diseases or higher sensitivities. In addition, urban heat also has an impact on our lifestyle and activity choices. In hot cities, people may reduce the time and intensity of outdoor activities to avoid excessive exposure to heat and sunlight. This can limit our options for outdoor exercise, socializing and recreation.","used public transportation, biking or walking instead of driving a car.; installed energy-efficient lighting or appliances in my home or weatherized my home; installed green infrastructure like a rain garden or rain barrel at my home or neighborhood; switched to renewable energy sources (e.g. solar panels or wind power) for my home.; participated in a carpooling program to reduce the number of cars on the road.; educated myself on sustainable living practices and shared this knowledge with others.; participated in local community gardening or tree-planting initiatives.","The government can promote urban greening programs to increase the vegetation coverage in cities by planting trees, building parks and green Spaces.","Word of mouth (e.g., from friends, family, or neighbors); Local news outlets (TV, radio, newspapers); Social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook)","Yes","Find out the extent of the local urban heat island effect, which is the temperature difference between a city and a suburb.

The most obvious way that people are impacted is through displacement. When the city becomes too hot to live in, people move out of the city and into other areas, leaving their homes behind. This is especially true in cities that have been built up over time and don't offer much in terms of green spaces or places to cool down.

Another way that people are affected is through their access to air conditioning. In some areas, there is no air conditioning at all—and if there is, it's not affordable for everyone who needs it. Others may not have access to electricity at all. This means that they're stuck without any way to cool down when temperatures rise too high.","used public transportation, biking or walking instead of driving a car.; switched to renewable energy sources (e.g. solar panels or wind power) for my home.; installed energy-efficient lighting or appliances in my home or weatherized my home; installed green infrastructure like a rain garden or rain barrel at my home or neighborhood","Local government can help mitigate urban heat in my community by encouraging the use of green roofs and other sustainable practices.","Local news outlets (TV, radio, newspapers); Social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook)","Yes","In the face of climate change, it's important for local governments to take steps to reduce urban heat.

"177","JudyMoss",590,"Jul 16, 2023, 08:41 PM","One hot summer day, I noticed my neighbor, an elderly lady, working hard in her garden. At that time, the temperature had exceeded 30 degrees Celsius and the sun was very strong. I noticed that she was pale and had sweat on her forehead, but she didn't seem to be aware of her condition. I immediately realized that she might be in danger of heat stroke, so I walked over to her and asked if she needed help. She insisted she was fine, just a little hot. However, her tone was vague and her actions became erratic. I immediately realized that this was an emergency, so I decided to take action right away. I helped her get out of the sun-soaked garden and into the shade. I offered her a glass of cold water and patted her cheek gently to help keep her awake. I called the emergency services immediately and told them about our situation. They sent an ambulance immediately.

In extreme heat, I could be at risk of heatstroke. Therefore, I will try to avoid going out during the hot peak period, especially between noon and afternoon. I choose to do outdoor activities in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid exposure to the hot sun. Secondly, hot weather will have an impact on my physical activity. I feel tired and weak in hot weather. This makes me more prone to sweating and dehydration, so I pay special attention to rehydration and choose to wear lightweight, breathable clothing for increased comfort. In addition, the heat in the city also affects the quality of my sleep. In hot summer weather, the temperature at night can be very high, causing me to have difficulty falling asleep or the quality of sleep is reduced. To combat this, I use a fan or air conditioner to keep the room at a comfortable temperature and make sure the bedding is breathable to promote a good night's sleep.","used public transportation, biking or walking instead of driving a car.; reduced my overall energy consumption at home (e.g. turning off lights and appliances when not in use).; switched to renewable energy sources (e.g. solar panels or wind power) for my home.; installed green infrastructure like a rain garden or rain barrel at my home or neighborhood; reduced my water consumption at home (e.g. taking shorter showers or using low-flow toilets).; participated in a carpooling program to reduce the number of cars on the road.; educated myself on sustainable living practices and shared this knowledge with others.","Provide public air conditioning facilities, increase green space and tree cover, provide public water facilities, etc.","Word of mouth (e.g., from friends, family, or neighbors); Government agencies (e.g., National Weather Service, FEMA); Social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook); Local news outlets (TV, radio, newspapers); Weather apps or websites (e.g., The Weather Channel, AccuWeather)","Yes","To understand the extent and scope of the urban heat island effect, to obtain temperature data for different areas within the city, to understand the population density, demographic composition and socio-economic status of different communities within the city, to obtain data on green space and tree cover within the city, and to collect health data related to hot weather, including the incidence of heat stroke and heat stress events, hospital visits and mortality.","0d4102950c307464","Active",177,"shanwotsonvsvsvsvs@gmail.com",NA,"No","Urban Triage",NA,"No",NA,1994,"$150,000 to $174,999","Bachelor’s degree","Resident; Worker",177,"shanwotsonvsvsvsvs@gmail.com","Urban Triage","6223 Lakeview Boulevard, Middleton, Wisconsin, 53562","No","White","1994","$150,000 to $174,999","Bachelor’s degree","43.0951457713315",-89.4865099415115,"81","6223 Lakeview Boulevard, Middleton, Wisconsin, 53562, , , ","Match","Exact","6223 LAKEVIEW BLVD, MIDDLETON, WI, 53562","49466579","L","55","025","011101","3005","53562","Not Hispanic","$150,000 to $199,999","Bachelors Degree or Higher","55025011101","550250111013005"

This makes the central areas of the city hotter than the suburbs, especially in the summer. The lack of green space in cities can also lead to individuals being disproportionately affected by urban heat. Trees and grass can absorb and reduce the transfer of heat, providing a shaded and cool environment. However, in cities, green space is limited due to the increase of buildings and roads, resulting in a lack of natural shading and cooling effects. Differences in the infrastructure of different neighborhoods in a city can also lead to individuals being disproportionately affected by urban heat. Some communities may have more green Spaces, parks, and lakes, providing better shelter from the heat. Other communities may lack these resources, leaving residents more vulnerable to the heat.","used public transportation, biking or walking instead of driving a car.; switched to renewable energy sources (e.g. solar panels or wind power) for my home.; participated in local community gardening or tree-planting initiatives.; reduced my water consumption at home (e.g. taking shorter showers or using low-flow toilets).; participated in a carpooling program to reduce the number of cars on the road.; educated myself on sustainable living practices and shared this knowledge with others.","Governments can mitigate the effects of urban heat by improving urban planning.

"236","Paul",554,"Jul 16, 2023, 03:23 AM","Many residents experienced heat stroke in the hot weather. These include people vulnerable to heat, such as the elderly, children and the chronically ill. They may experience symptoms of heat stroke such as dizziness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. In hot weather, the concentration of pollutants in the air may increase, which poses a threat to respiratory health. Residents may experience symptoms such as wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing, especially those who already have respiratory problems. Hot weather increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Residents may experience symptoms such as heart palpitations, chest tightness, and elevated blood pressure. For people who already have conditions such as heart disease and high blood pressure, hot weather can lead to more serious health problems. In hot weather, the human body is prone to water loss and electrolyte imbalance. Residents may experience dehydration symptoms such as thirst, headaches, weakness, and muscle cramps. Prolonged exposure to high temperatures can also lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can affect the body's normal functions.","Stayed indoors or in air-conditioned spaces - Often; Visited community cooling centers - Always; Drank plenty of water to stay hydrated - Always; Worn light-colored, loose-fitting clothing - Always; Avoided outdoor activities during the hottest parts of the day - Always; Used sunscreen to protect my skin from sunburn - Always; Checked on friends, family, or neighbors who may be vulnerable to extreme heat - Always","In some communities, housing conditions may be less than ideal, with inadequate insulation and ventilation. This makes residents more vulnerable to high temperatures, as their homes do not effectively block the heat. Some residents may face financial difficulties, unable to pay high electricity bills or buy air conditioning equipment. This makes it more difficult for them to stay cool in hot weather, increasing their risk of being affected by urban heat. In densely populated communities, tall buildings, concrete buildings and little green space can lead to a heat island effect. This means that residents in these communities are more vulnerable to urban heat because heat in these areas cannot be dissipated efficiently.","used public transportation, biking or walking instead of driving a car.; reduced my overall energy consumption at home (e.g. turning off lights and appliances when not in use).; switched to renewable energy sources (e.g. solar panels or wind power) for my home.; installed green infrastructure like a rain garden or rain barrel at my home or neighborhood; participated in local community gardening or tree-planting initiatives.; reduced my water consumption at home (e.g. taking shorter showers or using low-flow toilets).; participated in a carpooling program to reduce the number of cars on the road.","Create green Spaces and public Spaces, provide summer centers, provide economic assistance to special areas, and increase education and publicity.","Weather apps or websites (e.g., The Weather Channel, AccuWeather); Word of mouth (e.g., from friends, family, or neighbors); Social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook); Government agencies (e.g., National Weather Service, FEMA); Local news outlets (TV, radio, newspapers)","Yes","Learn how the urban heat island effect affects your community and the possible causes, such as building density, roads, and concrete use.

Although I repeatedly warned him to be cautious in the face of the heat wave, he always responded with optimism and said, ""I have experienced hot summers when I was young, I will be fine."" One day I noticed him continuing to work in the garden in the heat of midday. I was concerned that he might be affected by the heat wave, so I persuaded him to go inside and rest to avoid excessive exposure to the heat. However, he said he felt fine, just a little hot. When I got home a few hours later, I noticed that he wasn't moving around the yard as usual. I went to knock on the door, but I got no response. I was so worried that I immediately called the police and asked them to deal with the critical situation. Police and emergency services quickly arrived and entered his home. However, he had lost consciousness and was having difficulty breathing. Emergency personnel immediately began administering first aid, trying to restore his breathing and heartbeat, and rushed him to the hospital. Unfortunately, he eventually died of a heat attack. This heartbreaking incident has brought great shock and sadness to the entire community.","Stayed indoors or in air-conditioned spaces - Always; Visited community cooling centers - Often; Drank plenty of water to stay hydrated - Always; Worn light-colored, loose-fitting clothing - Always; Avoided outdoor activities during the hottest parts of the day - Often; Used sunscreen to protect my skin from sunburn - Often; Checked on friends, family, or neighbors who may be vulnerable to extreme heat - Always","Hot weather increases the risk of a range of health problems, including heat stroke, heat exhaustion and heat sickness.
